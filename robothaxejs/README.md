Simple RobotHaxe Demo targeting Javascript
==========

This is a port of the simple flash example in the [Robotlegs Demos Bundle](https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-demos-Bundle/tree/master/HelloFlash) on github.

I found these gists by Mike Cann to be very useful in creating a working demo:

## Disclaimer

I couldn't find any complete examples online of how [RobotHaxe](https://github.com/DavidPeek/robothaxe) is intended to be used so this may not be the best way to use the framework but this demo works fine.  It is supposed to be a direct port though and this demo is pretty close to the [original](https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-demos-Bundle/tree/master/HelloFlash) one.
