Sortable table example
==========

An implementation of a table that is populated with JSON data and is sortable and paginated.

##Libraries

* Backbonejs (framework)
* Underscore (utils)
* JQuery (dom traversal and events)
* Handlebars (templating)
* Requirejs (for modules and dependency management)
* Gruntjs (build tool)

##Instructions

You will need to install [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) first before you can create a build.  Once Grunt is installed you can simply enter the 'grunt' command in the terminal and it will run the default task. 

A sample build is located in 'dist/' and a live demo can be viewed [here](http://fboyle.com/dev/backbonetable/).
